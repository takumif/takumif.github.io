title: "We don't know how much something is worth to us and that's making market economies inefficient"

# Summary
- Market economies face inefficiencies due to two main issues:
    - Difficulty in accurately quantifying the true worth of goods and services to individuals.
    - People's willingness to pay often being influenced by market prices and social norms.

# I Like It, But I Don't Know How to Quantify That
I enjoy avocados and sea urchin, two foods that share several similarities. Both pair well with soy sauce, wasabi, and white rice, and offer rich, creamy textures. However, their quality can vary – sometimes they might taste less fresh or more bitter than expected.

The most significant difference between them, in my experience, is their price. The most recent avocado and sea urchin I purchased were approximately $0.50 and $20 per 100 grams, respectively – a 40-fold difference. Do I appreciate sea urchin 40 times more than avocados? Probably not. But by how much more do I value it? I don't know. This dilemma extends beyond my supermarket choices to the broader realm of market economics. We often assume people can precisely quantify the value of a good or service in monetary terms. This assumption, combined with supply factors, supposedly leads to market prices that facilitate efficient resource allocation and maximize societal wellbeing.

This is an oversimplification, but the underlying issue remains: prices shaped by our willingness to pay do not necessarily reflect the true value we derive from goods and services.

# My Willingness to Pay is Anchored to Previous Prices
Factors other than intrinsic value influence my willingness to pay. A significant factor is how current prices compare to those I recall. For example, if I find avocados and sea urchins priced at $1 and $10, down from $0.50 and $20, respectively, my inclination to purchase the sea urchin increases, despite it not necessarily offering ten times the enjoyment of an avocado. This phenomenon is likely due to the anchoring effect, where my willingness to pay is influenced by expected prices. A price higher or lower than anticipated feels disproportionately expensive or reasonable, respectively.

# The Implications on Market Economies
This misalignment between what we're willing to pay and the actual value goods and services provide could be a significant issue in market economics. If a substantial disconnect exists, market economies may inefficiently allocate resources, either overproducing items that don't significantly enhance happiness or underproducing those that do. This fundamental yet elusive problem poses a challenge: without quantifying the value that goods and services provide us, it's difficult to gauge the severity of this issue or identify effective interventions. To gain a deeper understanding, exploring beyond basic economic principles into fields like behavioral economics might be necessary. I'll report back with further insights as I delve deeper into this topic.
